# Employee_Management
Create, read, update, and delete employees with assigned roles (e.g., CEO, CTO, Team Leader). Employee code follows the format: first 4 letters of company name + incrementing number. Inactive roles are disabled on the add-employee site, preventing addition of employees for those roles.
